## Introduction
Hearthsearch will help the user search for different cards that are catagorized by their rarity. 
This would be important to users that are card collectors and those that need the specs for certain cards within their respective expansions.

## Why?
Why? Why not! This website would have all of the current cards in this game and would always be helpful during a stressful duel with a competitor.
